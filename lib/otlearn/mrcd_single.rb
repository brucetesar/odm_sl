module OTLearn
  
  # An MrcdSingle object contains the results of applying
  # MultiRecursive Constraint Demotion to a single winner, with respect
  # to a given grammar and a given loser selection routine.
  # It does not modify the grammar passed into the constructor.
  # Methods of the object will indicate if MRCD resulted in an (in)consistent
  # grammar, and return a list of the winner-loser pairs constructed and
  # added. If the caller wants to accept the results of MRCD, it should
  # append the list of added winner-loser pairs to its own grammar's support.
  class MrcdSingle
    
    # Returns a new MrcdSingle object.
    #
    # ==== Parameters
    # 
    # * +winner+ - the candidate the learner is attempting to make optimal.
    # * +grammar+ - the grammar being tested. This grammar is first
    #   duplicated internally, and so is not modified; the internal duplicate
    #   may have additional winner-loser pairs added to it.
    # * +selector+ - the loser selector (given a winner and an ERC list).
    # * +wl_pair_class+ - dependency injection parameter for testing.
