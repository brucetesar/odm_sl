  # A syllable for the SL system has two features, stress and length. It
  # also can have an affiliated morpheme.
  #
  # Learning algorithms are expected to use the "generic" interface,
  # consisting of the methods #each_feature() and #get_feature(). The
  # method #each_feature() is an iterator that yields each feature of the
  # syllable in turn, allowing other routines to work with syllables
  # without knowing in advance how many or what types of features they
  # have.
