# Compares two candidates with respect to ranking information, to
# determine if the second candidate can be more harmonic than the first,
# consistent with the ranking information. The comparison is performed
# with a call to the method #more_harmonic.

# *NOTE:* this is an asymmetric comparison. The interpretation of the
# return symbols remains consistent if the provided ranking information
# is consistent.
