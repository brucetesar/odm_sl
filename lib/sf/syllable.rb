  # A syllable for the SF system has one feature, stress. It also
  # can have an affiliated morpheme.
  #
  # Learning algorithms are expected to use the "generic" interface, consisting
  # of the methods #each_feature() and #get_feature(). The method #each_feature()
  # is an iterator that yields each feature of the syllable in turn,
  # allowing other routines to work with syllables without knowing in advance
  # how many or what types of features they have.
