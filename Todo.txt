Todo List for odm_sl

OTLearn::match_input_to_uf!(Word) (defined in data_manip.rb) should be
eliminated. Taking an output and parsing it with the grammar will give a
*new* word with the input matched to the lexicon.

OTLearn::match_input_to_output!(Word) (defined in data_manip.rb) should be
moved to be an instance method for class Word.

OTLearn::mismatches_input_to_output(word_param, &block) (defined in
data_manip.rb) currently is structured to allow for suprabinary features.
BUT: we don't currently have any examples using suprabinary features.
Make this method an instance method for class Word, and streamline it
to construct the single mismatched input. You can come up with something
more sophisticated if/when you work with examples that have suprabinary
features.

Add some basic field value validation to OTGeneric::Erc_conversion.

Refactor CSV_Output so that it is more symmetric with CSV_Input.
Move the lang_sim --> array conversions to other classes.

Implement a ranking information (erc list) only linguistic system and
grammar class. Use it to set up basic bin scripts for experimenting with
different ranking biases.

Create a LoserSelector class that checks all non-HB candidates as possible
losers.

Create some more substantive specs for Mrcd.

Either find some reasonable way to unit-test LoserSelector_by_ranking,
or delete the specs for it.
