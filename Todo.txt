Todo List for odm_sl

Refactor Win_lose_pair so that it uses delegation instead of inheritance.
Control access to methods instead of freezing. Eliminate the OTWP-specific
label manipulation (that should be done by the caller, if at all). Then
clean up the goofy label manipulation done in Mrcd.

Create some more substantive specs for Mrcd.

Either find some reasonable way to unit-test LoserSelector_by_ranking,
or delete the pending specs for it.

Track down and correct the specs that aren't specific enough about
what type of raised exception is expected. Get rid of those warnings.

Turn Hypothesis into an Erc_list class. Then have SL::Grammar
accept both an erc_list and a lexicon. For purely surface-driven
systems with no lexicon, create a system with a Grammar class that only
takes an erc_list. Then the learning methods should be accepting and
passing around Grammar objects of the sort they are expecting.
