Todo List for odm_sl

class Mrcd
Move the creation of the LoserSelector_by_ranking object outside of Mrcd,
and to every place where an Mrcd object is created, and pass it into
instances of Mrcd.

Delete the old Mrcd#select_loser method.

Document class Select_loser_by ranking

Create some more substantive specs for Mrcd.

Either find some reasonable way to unit-test LoserSelector_by_ranking,
or delete the pending specs for it.

Track down and correct the specs that aren't specific enough about
what type of raised exception is expected. Get rid of those warnings.

Turn Hypothesis into an Erc_list class. Then have SL::Grammar
accept both an erc_list and a lexicon. For purely surface-driven
systems with no lexicon, create a system with a Grammar class that only
takes an erc_list. Then the learning methods should be accepting and
passing around Grammar objects of the sort they are expecting.
