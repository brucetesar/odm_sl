UF_LEARNING.RB
Both uf_learning.rb and fewest_set_features.rb have methods named
test_unset_feature().

FewestSetFeatures#test_unset_feature(): set the target feature to match
surface, all other unset features to mismatch surface. See if it is consistent.

OTLearn.test_unset_feature(): find the number of consistent values of the
unset feature; if there is only one consistent value, set the feature. Accounts
for conflicting feature values within a set of words.

Most of the methods in uf_learning.rb are only called internally,
i.e., elsewhere in uf_learning.rb.
Called Outside
.set_uf_values() called by contrast_pair_learning, single_form_learning

.conflicting_output_values?() called by contrast_pair.rb

.find_unset_features_in_words() called by fewest_set_features.rb ONLY

.find_unset_features() called by contrast_pair.rb

.find_morphemes_in_words() called by contrast_pair.rb

OTHER
Add some basic field value validation to OTGeneric::Erc_conversion.

Implement a ranking information (erc list) only linguistic system and
grammar class. Use it to set up basic bin scripts for experimenting with
different ranking biases.

Spin off OTLearn.mismatch_consistency_check(), in data_manip.rb, as a
separate class dedicated to (in)consistency checking. See if there are
other parts of the code doing such checking that should be added into
this class.
