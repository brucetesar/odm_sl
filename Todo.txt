Todo List for odm_sl

Fold the functions of the current SL::Grammar into Hypothesis. After Hypothesis
is able to substitute for SL::Grammar, build a new SL::Grammar that is simply
a proxy for Hypothesis, so that Hypothesis essentially becomes the new
base grammar class.

Create an Erc_list class. Then have SL::Grammar
accept both an erc_list and a lexicon. For purely surface-driven
systems with no lexicon, create a system with a Grammar class that only
takes an erc_list. Then the learning methods should be accepting and
passing around Grammar objects of the sort they are expecting.

Implement a ranking information (erc list) only linguistic system and
grammar class. Use it to set up basic bin scripts for experimenting with
different ranking biases.

Create some more substantive specs for Mrcd.

Either find some reasonable way to unit-test LoserSelector_by_ranking,
or delete the pending specs for it.
